# 🚀 ShareConnect 2.0 - Manual GitHub Setup Guide

## ❌ Current Issue
Getting "Permission denied" error when trying to push to GitHub repository.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify Repository Exists
1. Go to: https://github.com/23se02cb064/shareconnect.2.0
2. If repository doesn't exist, create it:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `shareconnect.2.0`
   - Make it Public or Private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have code)
   - Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Check Personal Access Token Permissions
Your token needs these permissions:
- ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
- ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)

To check/update token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find your token and click "Edit"
3. Ensure all required scopes are selected
4. Click "Update token"

### Step 3: Manual Push Commands
Once repository is created and token has correct permissions:

```bash
cd /home/code/shadcn_init__

# Remove existing remote (if needed)
git remote remove origin

# Add your repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/23se02cb064/shareconnect.2.0.git

# Push with token authentication
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: `23se02cb064`
- Password: `your_personal_access_token`

### Step 4: Alternative - Create New Repository
If the above doesn't work, create a new repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create repository with a different name (e.g., `shareconnect-v2`)
3. Update remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/23se02cb064/shareconnect-v2.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
